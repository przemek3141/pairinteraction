Welcome to the *pairinteraction* documentation!
===============================================

The *pairinteraction* software simulates systems of one or two Rydberg atoms, taking into account electric and magnetic fields in arbitrary directions as well as multipole interaction up to arbitrary order. Properties as pair potentials, `blockade interaction`_, spectra, or excitation dynamics can be calculated. The software consists of a high-performance C++ library, a Python library as a convenient API, and an easy-to-use graphical user interface for pair potential calculations.
